## What are those numbers?

Did you want to record how much time you actually spent coding? That's essentially what **codespell** does. 

You see _**colorful numbers**_ in the console, and they are saved, behind the scenes, as JSON. That's how it shows you the usage of the last day. And though, only last day's usage is shown in the terminal, you can go read the JSON data yourself. 😏

See the list of [supported editors](#currently-supported-editors), and if your favorite editor is not currently listed, feel free to send a PR. (It's easier than you think! 😂)

***Note:*** Don't worry. If you close an editor, and re-open it, the time is added.

# Usage

It's published as a node module, and hence can be downloaded using ***npm***.

```bash
$ npm i -g codespell
```

Or, if you prefer ***yarn***

```bash
$ yarn global add codespell
```

That's it. 🎉 

You can now open a terminal, and fire the command `codespell`

```bash
$ codespell
```
